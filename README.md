## What's a progressive dinner 
A progressive dinner is a dinner party with successive courses prepared and eaten at the residences of different hosts.
Usually this involves the consumption of one course at each location. More details on the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_dinner).

## Precise formulation of the progressive dinner problem
The event involves $N$ couples having each course of a three-course meal at a different personâ€™s house, three couples at each course, every couple hosting once and no two couples meeting more than once. You can find the descripion by [Prof. D.S. Stinson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/) in his [publication](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2001.05394) on *Designing Progressive Dinner Parties* as a combinatorial problem.

## Optimization
Beyond finding a feasible solution, it is often desired to find a solution that minimizes the length of all travelled itineraries. This goes further than solving a multiple TSP problem.
